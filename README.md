# Reproducible Lakes

This repository contains the R markdown files for an internal presentation given to the EPA R User Group on June 21, 2017

Title:  R packages as a reproducible framework for lake and cyanobacteria research.
 
Blurb: R packages provide for easy re-use of R code and accomplish this through community maintained tools and a well-defined framework for bundling code, data, and documentation.   In addition to facilitating the growth of R, this infrastructure also serves as a useful starting point for research projects.  Over the last several years, we have used the R package as an organizing framework for our research on lakes and cyanobacteria.    In this talk I will cover two ways we make use of R pacakges, as research compendia and as a basis for general tooling for conducting lakes research.  I will finish with a demo of two packages: lakemorpho and elevatr.
